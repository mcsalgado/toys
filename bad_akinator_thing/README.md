This was a coding challenge where I had to write this Akinator-like program. They gave a working executable of the program and I had to reproduce its behavior as closely as possible.

I modeled it with a chained data structure (BadAkinatorThing/Category.cs), I figured they wanted to see if I knew about linked lists, trees or something.
