this was part of a live coding interview where I had to code the [SET card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

based on part of the game code the inverviewer asked me to code a more generic procedure to take a dictionary of properties and generate cards (which is equivalent to a generalized cartesian product) so I came up with these 2 different ways.
